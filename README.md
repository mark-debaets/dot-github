Just a generic GitHub repository template for all

## Overview

In [June of 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) GitHub announced repository templates, which allow for people/organizations to use boilerplate repositories for their projects (and cut out a lot of the initial overhead in a new project).

## Features

- [Community Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
- In-depth [Contribution](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
- Support for [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/)
- [Support](./.github/SUPPORT.md) documentation
- Templates for;
  - [Bug Reports](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md)
  - [Feature Requests](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/FEATURE_REQUEST.md)
  - [Pull Requests](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Pre-configured [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [gitattributes](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes), and [gitingore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) files

## Usage

The steps to use this template repository in your own projects are;

1. [Create a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) using this template
2. Rename this `README.md` file to something else, such as `TEMPLATE_README.md`
3. Rename the provided `BOILERPLATE_README.md` to `README.md`
4. Replace instances of `YOUR_*` in your new `README.md` to customize the [Shields](https://shields.io/), social links, etc to yourself and your project
5. Customize the rest of the repository to your hearts content
6. Start creating!
